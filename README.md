Module 12 - Bellybutton Biodiversity

## Overview
This is the repository for the deployed wepage on https://yaejinpark.github.io/plotly-deploy/.
The main objective of this module was to practice accessing data in a JSON format for visualization in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
Bootstrap and a little bit of custom css was applied in order to decorate the webpage.

## Three Changes in CSS
1. Jumbotron image included. Picture credits to UNICEF (original: https://www.unicef.org/northmacedonia/everything-you-need-know-about-washing-your-hands-protect-against-coronavirus-covid-19)

2. Background color added in an attempt to match the hand-washing image's background color.

3. Explanation for each chart added right below them.
